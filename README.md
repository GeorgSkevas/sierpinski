Mathematical Triangle Creation by Dots

It's a fractal formed by repeatedly removing the middle triangle from larger equilateral triangles.

At each step, the shape becomes more intricate, revealing a pattern of ever-smaller triangles.

The result is a self-similar structure with infinite complexity and zero area in the limit.
